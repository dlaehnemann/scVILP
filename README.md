# Description
**Variant-calling by Integer Linear Programming (VILP)** is a new approach to mutation calling in single cells with Perfect Phylogeny assumption using Integer Linear Programming formulations. VILP jointly calls mutations for each cell and estimates the Perfect Phylogeny of those cells in the presence of allelic dropouts and missing data. 
VILP is scalable to high number of cells and mutations by introducing a novel super-tree algorithm which could be run parallelly on multiple processors.
